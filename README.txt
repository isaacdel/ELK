Monitoring with ELK


The aim: experience monitoring cloud’s data


One of the main things we do in the cloud is monitoring.
Monitoring our data, our resources (memory, CPU, network and etc.), monitoring our logs, 
number of VMs we use, number of users we have and more.
One of the most used tools today is ELK. Actually it’s three tools: Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana.
This project takes the advantage of all three, in order to monitor the data.

Kibana 4.5.1 and above
